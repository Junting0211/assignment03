It is Jialin's minor and Dewey's and Islomzhan's major. They have very distinct backgrounds, but they all found a way of working in techonological projects they have been interested in. The 3 of them have come a long way since none of them were born in the US. It is apparent they are passionate about traveling as well.  </p> </div>
