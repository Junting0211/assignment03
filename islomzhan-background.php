        <h1> Background </h1> 
		<p>I am from the city of Osh in the Kyrgyz Republic, which is located in Central Asia. Upon my graduation of the high school I came to the United States. I’ve been to amazing places in Texas, Colorado, New York and California. Outside the US, I’ve been to Moscow, Russia and Tashkent, Uzbekistan. I speak Uzbek, Kyrgyz, Turkish, Russian, and Arabic along with English. Since 2017, I am studying Computer Science at University of Rochester.</p>
