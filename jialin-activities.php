        <h1> Activities </h1>
		<p> Outside of school works and internships, I spend my free time with my hobbies and moreover exploring my possibilities in different kinds of areas, including sports and music. I am particularly interested in playing tennis, swimming, skiing, and golf. During other times, I have dedicated my energy to philanthropy and charity activities in which I consider them significant and memorable. For six years, I have gone to Seattle annually and served as a volunteer to plan and hold fundraisers in order to help with the education of vision-impaired children; and the program has helped over fifty students to progress from elementary school through college. </p>
