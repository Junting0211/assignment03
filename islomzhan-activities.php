        <h1> Activities </h1> 
		<p>There was a need for a web designer at the North American University, and I was able to start a part time job at their IT Department. I use this term - a web designer because nowadays most of the web developers out there actually use web building applications that run on various types of Content Management Services like WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla with few or no coding involved.</p>
